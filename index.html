     <h2>Career</h2>
     <p>
        In 2002-2006, she began auditioning for various roles and met Demi Lovato during an audition for Barney & Friends.Gomez and Lovato were later selected to appear on the series in 2002.
        After her apparition on Barney & Friends, Gomez had a cameo role in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).
        She guest starred in a 2006 episode of the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.
        Selena Gomez landed minor roles in several other TV programs, but it was her affiliation with the Disney Channel - who discovered her during a nationwide talent search in 2004 - that officially jump-started her acting career. 
        Guest appearances on The Suite Life of Zach and Cody and Hannah Montana paved the way for Gomez's own show, The Wizards of Waverly Place, which premiered in October 2007 and quickly became one of the network's most popular programs. 
        Dubbed "the next Miley Cyrus, " Gomez began juggling her commitment to The Wizards of Waverly Place with additional projects, including movie roles and a burgeoning singing career.
        Selena Gomez began branching out into pop music by recording songs for her own Disney projects. 
        She sang the theme song for The Wizards of Waverly Place, recorded several other tunes for the the show's soundtrack, and performed on the soundtrack of the family film Another Cinderella Story. 
        By 2009, she'd also assembled her own teen pop band, Selena Gomez & the Scene, and signed a contract with Hollywood Records. The band's full-length debut, Kiss & Tell, was released that year and went gold, as did its 2010 follow-up, A Year Without Rain. 
        Gomez continued filming The Wizards of Waverly Place and made her theatrical debut in the 2010 film adaptation of Ramona and Beezus.
        When The Wizards of Waverly Place started airing its final season in November 2010, Gomez shifted her attention back to her band, whose third album, When the Sun Goes Down, was recorded in early 2011 and released later that year. 
        She then took a break from music to focus more on acting, with her first role in a decidedly adult movie in 2013's Spring Breakers showing she could stretch beyond teen stardom. Her return to music in 2013 with her fourth album - but the first credited to her as a solo artist - also showed some stretching as she added dubstep, R&B, and EDM to her sound. 
        Stars Dance was released in July of 2013.

     <h2>Personal Life</h2>
     <p>
        Her parents divorced when she was a small child, and she was raised by her mother. 
        Selena Gomez had romantic relationships with Justin Bieber and, more briefly, with The Weeknd.
        She was diagnosed with lupus sometime between 2012 and early 2014. 
        In September 2017, she revealed on Instagram that she had withdrawn from public events during the previous few months because she had received a kidney transplant from actress and friend Francia Raisa.
        During the transplant, an artery broke and emergency surgery was conducted to build a new artery using a vein from her leg.
        She has been open about her struggles with both anxiety and depression. 
        She began pursuing therapy in her early twenties and also spent time in treatment facilities.
        When she reached 100 million Instagram followers, Gomez said she "sort of freaked out" and has since taken several extended breaks from social media, due in part to negative comments.
        In April 2020, she revealed she has bipolar disorder.
